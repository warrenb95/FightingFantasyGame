            It was a bad idea from the start. Even though you were penniless and starving after 
            the money won during your last adventure ran out, you should have known better than to try 
            stealing from the stall of a fat merchant. Fat merchants get that way by making very, very 
            sure that no one else steals from them.
		</text>
		<text>
            Now you stand silently in the courtroom in Wolftown, awaiting the magistrate’s verdict.
            Suddenly the brooding silence is broken as a thin, robed man with a short, tangles beard
            rises to his feet in the public gallery.
		</text>
		<text>
            ‘The court recognises that Guild of Magicians’, the magistrate says uneasily.
		</text>
		<text>
            ‘May it please the court,’ the wizard says in a surprisingly powerful voice, 
            ‘the Guilds- requests the life and person of this prisoner.’
            Your heart sinks. Just when you thought things couldn’t get any worse! No one 
            knows what happens to prisoners who are claimed but the Wizards’ Guild, but you 
            can guess. Perhaps the will grind your liver up for one their potions, or sell your 
            soul to a Demon. The prospect of a lifetime in jail suddenly doesn’t seem so bad.
            ‘request granted’, the magistrates intones. ‘The prisoner is to be conveyed to the 
            Wizards’ Guild under escort.’ A murmur runs through the court as the guards lead you out…
		</text>
		<text>
            ‘Well, you might at least look a little more cheerful,’ the wizard says as you arrive as 
            the Guildhouse. ‘I offer you a chance to live.’ He chuckles at the look of suspicion you 
            throw at him. ‘Let me explain. Just over a decade ago, there was a sorcerer, a member of  
            this Guild, named Galthazzeth. His interest lay in creating magical cross-breeds, but he 
            went too far and was expelled. Now we have discovered that he has occupied an abandoned 
            mine at the edges of the mountains, where he is breeding an army of his abominations. 
		</text>
		<text>
            It is clear that he threatens to wreak revenge upon ass of us.’ The wizard looks grim.
            ‘His lair is well guarded, especially against sorcerers. But you , you are an adventurer.
            Your life is already forfeit, so you have nothing to lose -  and we offer you a chance to
            regain life and your freedom. Will you accept this mission?’
		</text>
		<text>
            You make up your mind. ‘You give me little choice. Where do I find this Galthazzeth?’
            ‘You will be given a map and all that we have found out about the lair,’ the wizard smiles,
            ‘once you have equipped yourself. Come!’

			Now you are fully equipped and ready for what leis ahead. The wizard walks with you to the

            Following the directions you were given by the Wizards Guild, you trek for many days,
            first through scrubland and the thick forest, until you draw close to the clearing where 
            the entrance to Galthazzeth’s underground lair can be found. A cliff face rises sheer above 
            the forest to a height of over 60 metres to the first of the plateaux fringing the mountains.
            From the edge of the clearing you peer cautiously out at the dark entrance to the mine.

			Roll your Attack Strengths as usual: if you win, you have avoided the spray; if you 
			lose, Test your Luck. If you are Lucky , the spray has not hit your eyes; deduct 1 point 
			from your STAMINA. If you are Unlucky, you are blinded for a moment; deduct 2 points
